# Machine-Problem-Address-Book
The machine problem is an address book program using bash script programming language. It that can perform such functionalities like Add Contact, Edit Contact, Delete Contact, View Contacts with sort and search functionality, Load Contacts via batch file, and Logs functionality. Data of contacts from the address book are saved in a text file called “addbook.txt”. For every input of data, the program checks the validity of each and prompts the user with its corresponding output error/result. Such error and result prompts are recorded on a log text file called “logs.txt” which can also be accessed through the Logs Functionality of the program. When adding contacts into the address book, the “First Name”, “Middle Name”, and “Last Name” of the contact owner should be unique in order for the program to accept the provided contact, otherwise it will prompt the user that this particular person is already existing from the address book. The sorting algorithm used in this program to sort the data in ascending order is the Selection Sort Algorithm. 
## Basic Functionalities of the Address Book
1.	Add Contact
2.	Edit Contact
3.	Delete Contact
4.	View Contacts with sort and search functionality  
5.	Load Contacts via batch file
6.	Logs functionality
## Prerequisites
1. Oracle VM VirtualBox
2. Ubuntu ISO file
### Execution of the Machine Problem Address Book program
1.	Open the terminal on the virtual machine and extract the JAWOD_MP.tar.gz on the home directory with the tar command. 
2.	Once extracted, change current directory to the extracted folder from the home directory named JAWOD_MP.
3.	Change location of the PATH variable.
4.	Apply executable permissions on each script files.
5.	Run the mp.bash file to execute the program.
See User Manual for detailed instructions of each functions.
